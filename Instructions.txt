For the given assigment i have used BeautifulSoup library for the data scarpping.

I First read the input.xlsx file and then use the for loop to iterate each URL in the file, 
scarpped the title and Description from the URL and then performed operations to find the DATA VARIABLES 

afte the operation is done saved the data variables in the dictionary , and then outside of the loop we convert the output to DataFrame.
afte it converted the DataFrame into excel.
